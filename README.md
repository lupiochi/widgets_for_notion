# Widgets for Notion

A growing collection of custom widgets designed for enhanced productivity within Notion, built for personal use on my PhD productivity pages.
These widgets integrate seamlessly into Notion, helping manage tasks, workflows, and time more effectively. 

The repository currently features a Pomodoro Timer and the Rulegraph Assistant.

## Current Widgets

### Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Timer widget is designed to help break work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break. This technique boosts productivity by encouraging consistent focus and regular rest periods. The timer is fully customizable for different work and break intervals, making it adaptable to any workflow.

#### Features:
- Customizable work and break intervals.
- Visual cues to signal the start and end of each session.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

### Rulegraph Assistant
The Rulegraph Assistant is an interactive tool for visualizing and managing workflow pipelines and relationships. It allows users to define tasks or steps in a project, visualize the dependencies between them, and manipulate the workflow graphically.

#### Features:
- Add steps with custom names and statuses.
- Define and edit relationships between steps using various line styles and colors.
- Undo the last step or clear the entire graph with a single click.
- Export the workflow as a .png file for easy sharing and reference.
- Adaptive, responsive design for seamless use across different devices and screen sizes.
